## Motivation:
<p align="">
  During my GA bootcamp cohort, I worked on Yu-Gi-Oh browser card battle game hosted on this url 
  <a>https://m-truong.github.io/project_1_marg/#</a>.
  I've decided to revisit my original project and rebuild it using a microservices approach with a mFE and BFF service layer. This repository is the NestJS/GraphQL backend that'll handle the Yu-Gi-Oh API.

## Game Summary:

  <p align="left">
    Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game is a Japanese card battle game where two players draw cards from their respective decks and take turns playing cards on the field. There are Monster, Spell, and Trap type cards, but for my adaptation of the game, I only implemented Monster Cards as a playable feature. At the start of every turn, five monster cards are randomly drawn for each player. A player begins their turn by clicking on the "Begin Attack Phase" button. They then must choose a Monster Card on their side of the field to attack another Monster Card on the opponent's side of the field. After clicking the "Confirm Attack Phase" button, damage dealt to an opponent player's life points is calculated using the Monster Card's Attack Point values.
